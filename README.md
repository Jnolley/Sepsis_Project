# Sepsis Determination App

The Sepsis detection app connects to OpenMRS and, given a patient ID,
automatically determines whether or not that patient has symptoms indicative of
Sepsis using the MD Anderson Cancer Center Sepsis determination algorithm. The app will report one of seven outcomes. It could report that the patient has Sepsis or has experienced Septic Shock. It could report that the algorithm could not be run because the patient is either pregnant or is not an adult. It could report a Code Blue meaning the patient is unresponsive. It could report that the patient should continued to be monitored. If the algorithm fails then it will report Indeterminate.

Project status: **feature-complete, algorithm unit tested, application manually tested, no test failures, no known
bugs**

## Dependencies

The heart failure detection app depends on
[the OpenMRS REST connector](https://git.unl.edu/soft-core/soft-160/openmrs-rest-connector).
The REST connector must be in the project's build path during development and
the project's classpath when the app is run.

To run, the REST connector in turn requires a running instance of OpenMRS either
on the same computer or accessible over a network.

For development, JUnit 4 is required to run the project's unit tests.

## Building

The app can be built and packaged as a JAR by running `mvn package` from the
`sepsis` folder. The project can also be imported into Eclipse, in which
case Eclipse will build the `.class` files, but not a JAR.

## Running

For development, `SepsisDeterminationApp.java` can be run in Eclipse by
right-clicking on it in the "Package Explorer" and selecting "Run As" â†’ "Java
Application".

Once packaged, the app can be run with the command

````
java -jar sepsis.jar
````

where `sepsis.jar` is the name of the JAR that was built (which may vary
depending on your Maven configuration.)

The Sepsis determination app will prompt for the URI, port number, and
login credentials to the OpenMRS server. Enter this information as requested.

The app will then prompt the user for a patient ID. Once the patient ID has been
entered, the app will print a report for that patient. If the patient ID is left
blank, the app will exit. Once the app is connected to your patient, it will prompt
for the data points necessary to make a sepsis determination.

## Software Architecture

The Sepsis detection app is organized into three tiers: a connector to
the OpenMRS backend&nbsp;(`rest_backend`), an implementation of the Sepsis determination algorithm&nbsp;(`sepsis`), and a command-line
interface&nbsp;(`cli`):

1.  The `rest_connector` package mostly contains classes for representing OpenMRS
    types locally:

	*   `PatientRecord.java`
	*   `ObservationRecord.java`

	An additional file connects the program to the online server and pulls the 
	data:

	*   `RestConnection.java`


2.  The `sepsis` package contains multiple files:

 	*   `SepsisDetermination.java`
	*   `SepsisDeterminationApp.java`
	*   `SepsisDeterminationAlgorithm.java`
	*   `Concept.java`
	*   `Observation.java`
	

	The Sepsis determination algorithm itself is implemented by
    several classes, which perform most of their computation at
    construction but can also act as return types:

	*   `Concept.java`
	*   `Observation.java`


	Sepsis determination algorithm calculates the determination from
	the values pulled from the openMRS database:

	*    `SepsisDeterminationAlgorithm.java`

	

	The SepsisDetermination file conatains the code creates the enumerated
	types to be output to support the algorithm :

	*   `SepsisDetermination.java`

	Finally the SepsisDeterminationApp contains the code that interacts with
	the user and gets the values that are not gotten from the OpenMRS database
	This is the file that makes the text boxes pop up and prompts the user
	for the necessary data :

	*   `SepsisDetermination.java`



## Testing  & Test Results

The sepsis determination app has been verified with automated unit tests
of the sepsis determination algorithm and manual system tests of the
app as a whole. Both types of tests were designed using the specifications
provided to derive categories and partitions to support category-partition
testing. The test suites were then augmented to achieve 100% code coverage. The
manual tests are documented in separate files we created
called `Manual Tests`, which is in the `documentation` folder.

Unit tests are available in the classes in the `test` folder:

*   `SepsisDeterminationAlgorithmTest.java`


The unit tests require JUnit 4.

Manual tests are documented as Markdown in the `Manual Tests` folder. Each test
includes:

*   The steps necessary to reset the test environment (i.e., the OpenMRS
    database),
*   The manual system testing steps, including the steps to run the app and
    specific values to enter at each step, and
*   The steps necessary to verify the output with respect to the expected output
    to determine if the test has passed or failed.

The manual tests require the use of the openMRS online database and the use of
patient data from there.

No UI testing, security testing, or load/stress testing was performed for this
milestone.

The app is passing all unit-level and Manual tests. The unit-level tests
achieve 100% statement coverage of the code developed by our team.
